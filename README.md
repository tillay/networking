A collection of files I use for different tasks regarding Networking

- mac-roller.sh
  
  requires dependency macchanger which can be installed via your package manager.
  
  Does exactly what it says, and changes your mac adress automatically.
  
- SecureW2_JoinNow.run
  
  allows the user to connect to university eduoroam wifi.
  
  can be downloaded from other sites but kinda hard to find
